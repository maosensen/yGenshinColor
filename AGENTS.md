# AGENTS.md

This file is the **single source of truth** for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository. Tool-specific entry points (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`) should only reference this file so guidance stays unified.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm 10.x (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`)

## Core commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # Turbopack dev server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm start            # Run production build
pnpm check            # biome check + tsc --noEmit (aggregate gate)
pnpm check-types      # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint             # biome check (lint + format check)
pnpm lint:fix         # biome check --write
pnpm format           # biome format --write
```

### UI component workflow

```sh
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

- Components land in `src/components/ui/` and are **owned by this repo** — edit them freely.
- The `@shadcn-space` registry is configured in `components.json` for dashboard blocks.
- For new themes / token changes, prefer `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init --preset <id>` over manual CSS variable edits.

### Tests

There is currently no test runner configured in this repository, so there is no supported single-test command yet.

## Architecture overview

This is a **single Next.js 16 app** (App Router + TypeScript + React Compiler), intended as a personal template/starter.

```

### Cross-cutting wiring

- Routes that need the sidebar/header shell go inside the `(app)` group; marketing/auth pages can live outside it to opt out.
- Sidebar navigation is data-driven via `navData` in `src/components/shadcn-space/blocks/dashboard-shell-01/app-sidebar.tsx`; nav items use `next/link` and highlight by `usePathname()`.
- `@/*` alias maps to `src/*`.
- Remote images are served via `next/image`; allowed hosts live in `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts`.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + React Compiler
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Lint & format:** Biome — single tool, do not add ESLint or Prettier
- **Package manager:** pnpm — do not generate `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`; delete them if they appear
- **Dev server:** Turbopack (default via `next dev`) — do not fall back to webpack unless there is a concrete incompatibility

## Standard libraries

Use these for their respective domains. Do not introduce alternatives without explicit approval.

| Domain | Library |
|---|---|
| Logging | `pino` (+ `pino-pretty` in dev) — import from `@/lib/logger` |
| Client state | `zustand` — stores under `src/lib/stores/` |
| IDs | `nanoid` |
| Animation | `motion` (the package formerly known as framer-motion) |
| Date / time | `date-fns` |
| Server state / fetching | `@tanstack/react-query` — `QueryClient` factory at `@/lib/get-query-client` |
| Theme | `next-themes` — wrapped in `@/components/theme-provider` |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `zod` + `@hookform/resolvers` |
| Charts | `recharts` via shadcn `ChartContainer` (`@/components/ui/chart`) |
| Toasts | `sonner` (`@/components/ui/sonner`) |

**Explicitly out of scope:**

- ❌ `axios` — use native `fetch` (react-query handles caching)
- ❌ ESLint / Prettier — Biome covers both
- ❌ `npm` / `yarn` commands — always `pnpm` (`pnpm dlx` instead of `npx`)
- ❌ `moment` / `dayjs` — `date-fns` only

## Next.js (read the installed docs, not training data)

This repo uses **Next.js 16**. Assumptions from training data or older articles may differ from the actual APIs, conventions, and recommended directory structure. **Before writing framework-related code**, read the docs bundled with the installed package and follow deprecation warnings:

- `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`
- Verify the resolved version with `pnpm why next` or `package.json` if in doubt.

## UI and styling constraints

### Theme & colors

The brand color is **`#2b7eff`** (`oklch(0.617 0.208 259.473)`). All theme tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` (`:root` + `.dark`); the chart scale `--chart-1` … `--chart-5` is derived from the same hue.

Color usage priority:

1. Prefer shadcn semantic theme variables (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, …).
2. For multi-dataset charts, use Chart variables `--chart-1` … `--chart-5`.
3. If more variants are needed, derive from base variables + opacity (e.g. `bg-primary/10`, `color-mix(..., transparent)`), not new hardcoded values.
4. Hardcoded color literals (`bg-white`, `text-black`, hex values, raw Tailwind palette colors for brand accents) are forbidden. Palette colors (`teal-400`, `orange-400`, …) are tolerated only as **data-differentiating** accents in demo blocks, never as the brand/primary color.

### Theming system (settings panel)

The runtime theme system (presets, custom brand color, neutral families, contrast, elevation, nav color, radius, fonts) is documented in **`docs/theming.md`** — read it before touching theme tokens, the settings drawer, or building new surface-level components. Hard rules:

- The settings pipeline has two reflectors that **must stay mirrored**: `settings-effect.tsx` (runtime) and `settings-script.tsx` (pre-paint FOUC script). A setting or migration applied in one but not the other is a bug.
- Adding a setting → follow the 6-step checklist in `docs/theming.md` (config → store → effect → script → drawer + isDirty → CSS).
- Any new grey-bearing token in `globals.css` must use the neutral parameterization (`oklch(L calc(C * var(--neutral-tint)) var(--neutral-hue))`), or it won't follow the Base color setting.
- Elevation is token-driven, two classes only: static surfaces (in the page) use `--shadow-card`/`--card-ring` (already wired into `Card`); floating surfaces (above the page) use `--shadow-overlay`/`--overlay-border`. Never put a hardcoded `shadow-*` and a visible border on the same surface; opt out with `shadow-none`/`ring-0`. Flat shadow states are `0 0 #0000`, never `none` (ring and shadow share one `box-shadow` list).
- Components hosted on nav surfaces inherit color (`currentColor`) instead of hardcoding `text-foreground`; a dark surface hosting generic components re-points `--accent` via the `data-surface="nav"` scope pattern.

### Recharts

- Pie charts (`<Pie>`) must render **clockwise from 12 o'clock**: always set `startAngle={90} endAngle={-270}` (the Recharts default `0 → 360` starts at 3 o'clock counter-clockwise, which is unintuitive).
  - Exception: gauges/half-circles that intentionally specify their own angles keep them; the rule applies to full-circle pies only.
- Chart components are client components (`"use client"`); colors come from `ChartConfig` referencing `--chart-*` / `--primary`.

### General

- Avoid over-design: keep shadcn defaults for padding and sizing; radius and elevation come from the theme tokens (`--radius`, `--shadow-card`, `--shadow-overlay`). Do not add ad-hoc radius/shadow/spacing utilities without a clear, documented requirement.
- Every page wraps its content in `<PageContainer>` (`@/components/page-container`) — it provides the page padding and obeys the Max Width setting. Do not hardcode `max-w-* mx-auto` page wrappers.
- Prefer `@/components/ui` primitives; do not re-implement equivalents inline:
  - `<Button>` not `<button className="...">`
  - `<Card>` not `<div className="rounded border...">`
  - `<Table>` not `<table className="...">`
  - `<Dialog>` / `<Sheet>` not custom modal `<div>` stacks
  - `<Select>` not native `<select>`

## Conventions

### Environment variables

- All env vars are declared in the zod schema in `src/lib/env.ts` and read via
  `import { env } from "@/lib/env"` — never read `process.env` directly in app
  code (the only exceptions are `env.ts` itself and `next.config.ts`).
- Adding a variable = schema (server / client / shared) + `runtimeEnv` map +
  `.env.example` entry. Client-exposed vars must use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
- Validation runs at build/dev startup (imported by `next.config.ts`), so a
  missing or malformed variable fails fast instead of at runtime.

### Error & status pages

- Full-page 4xx/5xx states use `<StatusPage>` (`@/components/status-page`) so
  they stay visually consistent; don't hand-roll centered error markup.
- Conventions already wired: global 404 (`src/app/not-found.tsx`), in-shell 404
  (`(app)/not-found.tsx`), in-shell error boundary (`(app)/error.tsx`),
  root-crash fallback (`src/app/global-error.tsx`), and a group-level loading
  skeleton (`(app)/loading.tsx` — override per page when the shape matters).
- Next 16.2 error boundaries receive `unstable_retry` (re-fetch + re-render);
  prefer it over the legacy `reset`.

### Logging

- Always import the shared logger: `import { logger } from "@/lib/logger"`
- Don't `console.log` in committed code — use `logger.debug` / `logger.info` / `logger.warn` / `logger.error`
- Log structured objects, not concatenated strings: `logger.info({ userId, action }, "user logged in")`

### State

- **Client-only ephemeral state:** `useState` / `useReducer`
- **Cross-component client state:** zustand store under `src/lib/stores/`
- **Server data:** `@tanstack/react-query` — never put server response data into zustand

### Forms

- Schema first: define a `zod` schema, infer the TS type from it
- Wire to `react-hook-form` via `@hookform/resolvers/zod`
- Don't write manual validation logic alongside zod

### Provider stack

Root layout wraps children in `<Providers>` from `@/components/providers`. The order is `QueryClientProvider` → `ThemeProvider`. Don't change the order without a reason — `next-themes` reads from `localStorage` and needs to be inside any client-only context.

`<html>` must carry `suppressHydrationWarning` for `next-themes` to work without console noise.

### Naming

New files use kebab-case.

## Known issues

- **Turbopack dev CSS cache (Next 16.2.x):** edits to `src/app/globals.css` theme variables are sometimes served stale by the dev server even after recompile. If colors don't update after a hard refresh: stop the dev server → `rm -rf .next/dev` → `pnpm dev`.

## Git commit messages

Write commit messages in **English**, following conventional commit prefixes:

- Line 1: type + summary (e.g. `feat: add dashboard app shell from shadcn-space/dashboard-shell-01`)
- Prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `test`, …
- Optional body: briefly explain the why/background

## Code style (Biome)

Biome handles both linting and formatting (no ESLint or Prettier). Key settings (`biome.json`):

- 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas (Biome defaults)
- `organizeImports` is enforced as an assist action
- Next + React recommended rule domains are enabled
- shadcn components under `src/components/ui/**` have relaxed rules (a11y, `noArrayIndexKey`, `noDangerouslySetInnerHtml`, etc.) because they are upstream-managed — do not "fix" upstream patterns there, and do not extend these relaxations to app code

## Before committing

1. `pnpm lint` passes
2. `pnpm build` passes (catches type errors that dev mode tolerates)
3. No `console.log` in committed code
4. No new top-level dependencies introduced without justification
